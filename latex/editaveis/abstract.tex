 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
  Programming is one of the most important disciplines in Computer Science and Software Engineering courses, but it can also be one of the most challenging to learn. This work highlights some of the main difficulties related to the teaching and learning of programming and proposes the development of software aimed at minimizing them. The proposed tool will allow Python code to be executed directly in the browser, eliminating the need for technical requirements to be installed on the student's machine. Additionally, it will offer canvas drawing features to facilitate program execution visualization and enable student interaction.

  Moreover, the platform will include a quiz to reinforce theoretical learning and practical projects that will allow students to create interactive games in real-time and receive feedback on their progress. Teachers can also evaluate students based on their quiz responses and project creations.

  A proof of concept was successfully carried out using the Pyodide and PixiJS libraries, and the results showed that the construction of the platform is feasible.
