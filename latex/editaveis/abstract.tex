 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
  Programming is one of the most important aspects of Computer Science and Software
  Engineering, while also being one of the most difficult topics to learn. The present academic work highlights some of the main difficulties related to programming teaching and
  learning, and proposes the development of a software with the minimization of these obstacles in mind. The proposed tool must allow Python code execution from a browser,
  and also offer resources for drawing in canvas, as to facilitate visualization of a program
  execution. A proof of concept has been made, utilizng the Pyodide and PixiJS libraries,
  and it has come to the conclusion that this software development is viable.
