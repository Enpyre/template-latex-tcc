\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
  This paper presents a proposal for a tool to minimize the difficulties of teaching and learning programming. The tool is an online platform that allows the execution of Python code directly in the browser, eliminating the need for technical requirements installation on the student's machine. In addition, the platform offers a playful approach to programming teaching, through quizzes to fix content and game creation to exercise programming logic. The tool was developed using the Pyodide library, which allows the execution of Python code in the browser using Web Assembly technology. The interface of the tool was developed using the PixiJS library, which allows the creation of 2D games in the browser. The tool was developed as a Final Course Work and is available at \url{https://enpyre-play.vercel.app/}.
